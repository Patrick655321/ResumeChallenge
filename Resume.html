    <h2>Career Objective</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently seeking to immerse myself in the tech industry. Initially exploring this interest through a 
        web development bootcamp, I am currently studying cyber security. It is here that I first dipped my toes into 
        cloud technology and realised that there is a lot of cool stuff here to learn. We hadn't even completed our 
        6-day module on cloud technology and I was already studying for the AWS CCP exam, which I have since passed. 
        I am now working on the Cloud Resume Challenge (no cheating, promise!) so that I can develop a portfolio to 
        further my career.
